# Introduction

If you want to learn how to interact with the TIS API (Tesserae Intertext Service Application Programming Interface), you've come to the right place.  The information presented here includes the promises we make about what you can expect from us, dependent on what we expect from you ("specifications", they say).  We'll also present examples to help set expectations.

If you're new to web API's, you might want to start with [the tutorial](getting-started/tutorial.md).

If you're comfortable with web API's but new to the TIS API, take a look at [the example workflow](getting-started/workflow.md).

If you want to know more about a particular endpoint, look under the "Endpoints" dropdown along the top of the page.

## About Us

Who are "we"?  We are digital humanists, associated with the Tesserae project.  We are interested in intertextual relationships, and we use computational methods to aid us in finding them.

Our current site is available at https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/.

The API described on this site is currently served off of https://tess-new.caset.buffalo.edu/api/.
